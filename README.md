# Heart-Disease-risk-Predictor-AI
A user-friendly, real-time heart disease risk prediction web app built with Streamlit and powered by machine learning. This project uses clinical data to help assess whether a patient is likely to have heart disease. Designed for healthcare students, beginners in AI/ML, and researchers interested in medical diagnostics
heart-disease-risk-predictor-ai is an open-source web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a machine learning model trained on clinical data. The app is built with Streamlit, allowing anyone — even without coding skills — to input simple health metrics and get an immediate risk prediction.

Using a Logistic Regression model with a scikit-learn pipeline, this app demonstrates how AI can support medical diagnostics in a transparent and interpretable way.

This project is perfect for:

AI & Data Science beginners learning model deployment

Medical or biochemistry students interested in predictive analytics

Educators or researchers creating real-time ML demos

Features include:

Real-time risk prediction from user inputs

Pre-trained ML model with preprocessing pipeline

Clean, responsive Streamlit UI

Easy deployment to the web (Streamlit Cloud or local)
